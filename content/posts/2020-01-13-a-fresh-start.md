Welcome 2020. Today I held my lazy bone and said, fuck you! one way or the other you are gonna setup this blog. It's been fucking half year of procrastination. 

Alas! here I go. 

Medium has been a great place to write. One of the cleanest UI I have ever seen on any product, but my reason to switch is nothing to do with medium's shortcomings or problems. I just wanted one space for all my crap. Here I'm planning of dumping all my thoughts, be it tech, startups, management, people or some random philosophy 🙊. 

I'd like to attribute [`gatsby-starter-lumen`](https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen) for this beautiful setup of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I thought of setting up the entire static blog pipeline myself, but I realised midway, I still haven't figured out some internals of how these two work internally. So I decided to start with this. I'll probably strip things off from this template and slim it down to only things I need. My fingers are rusty, haven't written in a long time, I need to catch up. Fuck my typos and grammar for now.

So, keeping my fingers🤞. I want to blog on travel, tech  mainly, if I could think strongly now. Also I will make a separate section to keep track of the books I'm reading, maybe plug in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to a page and show a table.

Alright, lets start small.

Bye for now.

👋🏻
