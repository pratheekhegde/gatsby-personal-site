I stumbled upon this bizzare concept of compiling a list of things you would ever want to do in your life. It's unlike a typical bucket list. It doesn't matter if you every cross all of it. But having a list makes you motivated and determined to atleast give it a shot. I came across this while I was reading Thomas Frank's [blog](https://collegeinfogeek.com/). He credits this original idea to Joel Runyon. Joel's [blog](https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/) is now defunct, but you could still access it on the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/).

Your Impossible List could vaguely consists of the following things:
- Things you want to do with your life.
- Things you want to do, but have told yourself is “impossible”
- Things you want to do, but someone else told you was impossible.

So here's my stab at it.
