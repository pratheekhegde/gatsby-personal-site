Hello 👋🏻**Creatures**, I'm Pratheek Hegde.

I'm a Software Developer working in Bangalore, born and brought up in a small town called Kundapur in Karnataka, India. 

I'm  **self-taught** and I love to **build** and **break** things. I get intrigued and fascinated by observing things happening around me. Nature, Physics, Space, Math are my interests despite being bad at it.

Lately I have been building Products and Tools on the Web Platform with **Javascript.** React**,** Node, TypeScript, GraphQL, Go are few of the technologies I like to work with.

I’m a dilettante and a dabbler but sometimes I tie myself to music 🎤, movies, travel, fitness, books 📚 and beer 🍺.
